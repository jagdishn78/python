Network Unavailbility -- (Connection to Client is Failed)

Check that the fully qualified domain name (FQDN), short-name, and IP all return correctly with nslookup. 
Do a ping and nslookup, from both directions, Client and NetWorker server sides. Use both the Hostname and IP address.
Check any firewalls that NetWorker ports are not blocked. 
Check if Hosts file entries are correct as per the requirement. 
To Cross check  Go into the NMC GUI
		Open CLIENT Properties
		Open Global's 1 of 2.  
		In the Alias text area and add the Long Name, Short Name, and IP address of the client.
Check if NetWorker Services/daemon is started on the client machine. Restart the NetWorker client services.
If all the Above are good and network is up then rerun the Job and wait for Job Completion. 
If all the Above are good then rerun the Job and still the Network is down then assign to L2.

Networker Agent Issue : 

Check if NetWorker Services/daemon is started on the client machine. Restart the NetWorker client services. 
For example : nsrexecd service 
Check the port for networker agent is avaialble. 
If all the Above are good and networker agent in clinet machine is up then rerun the Job and wait for Job Completion. 
After all steps, still the Networker agent is down then assign to L2.
 

Media Management Issue -- (Storage Node not coming to Ready State)

Check whether the nsrsnmd is up and running.    
        - Windows : tasklist | findstr nsrsnmd         
            - Linux : ps -ef | grep nsrsnmd    
If Services are down start the the services. 
Confirm whether the Connectivity between the Storage Node and NetWorker Server and Vice Versa.    
Check whether the ports are open that is the Service Ports from 7937 - 9936 and 111 Port for Port Mapper.
If all the Above are good and storage media is online then rerun the Job and wait for Job Completion. 
If all the Above are good and still the Storage Node is not coming up then assign to L2.   


Database Backup Server Issue -- Error: Failed to set the database backup server. permission denied

Check that the fully qualified domain name (FQDN), short-name, and IP all return correctly with nslookup. 
Do a ping and nslookup, from both directions, Client and NetWorker server sides. Use both the Hostname and IP address.
Check if Database Services/daemon is started on the machine.Restart the services in case of not. 
Check any firewalls that NetWorker ports are not blocked. 

Long running backup Issue -- (Backup for client xxx is taking more time) 

Check if the process

1.Check if NetWorker Services/daemon is started on the client machine.  Restart the NetWorker client services.
2.Check the local network. Do a ping and nslookup, from both directions, Client and NetWorker server sides. Use both the Hostname and IP address.
3.Try to run a backup from the client
4.Go into the NMC GUI and open CLIENT Properties, and open Global's 1 of 2.  In the Alias text area and add the Long Name, Short Name, and IP address of the client.
5.Check the Host entry on the NetWorker Server as well as Client.
6.Does the Client have a dual NIC? If so disable one NIC or check the DNS entry in your DNS server and make sure both are listed. Add them both into the HOSTS file.
7.Put NetWorker Server name in the "server file" on the client. On Windows: generally it is in location C:\Program files\legato\nsr\res\servers. On Unix change to the directory /nsr/res/servers
8.Add the entry in servers file of client for the backup server. After putting entry in servers file, restart Networker services on client.
9.In DNS, change the Forward and Reveres lookup and add the IP address in DNS.
10.Check your login name/password if you are running backups with separate login

1) Ensure that the NetWorker services are running on the NetWorker client:    
      Windows: tasklist | findstr nsr      
      Linux: ps -ef | grep nsr      
      Note: the NetWorker server service is nsrexecd (NetWorker Remote Exec Service)      
           
      If it is not running attempt to start the process:    
    
      Windows: net start nsrexecd      
      Linux: /etc/init.d/networker start       
      Note: confirm that the service starts by running the tasklist OR ps commands again.    
    
      2) Ensure that the NetWorker server and client can communicate and resolve each others hostnames/IPs, use ping and nslookup commands on the NetWorker server and client.    
    
      Note: confirm that the fully qualified domain name (FQDN), short-name, and IP all return correctly with nslookup. If a response fails, host file entries may need to be created for the host which failed to resolve using DNS. Any network/name resolution issue(s) should be resolved by your domain/network administrator.    
      
      3) Confirm that the NetWorker service/connection ports are not being blocked by OS or network firewalls.    
    
      Service ports: 7937-9936    
    
      Connection ports: 0-0      
      Note: See the NetWorker Security Configuration Guide for your NetWorker version(s) for more information on firewall and port settings. These documents can be found at https://support.emc.com    
    
      
      Once the above has been confirmed you should be able to remotely connect to the NetWorker client from the NetWorker server (and vise versa) by running the following command:    
    
      nsradmin -p nsrexec -s client-name      
      This command will open a remote connection to the nsrexecd service on the other (client/server) host      
      User-added image      
      Note: If the nsradmin prompt appears the connection has been made. Enter quit to exit out of the prompt    

1. Open NetWorker Management Console 
2. Select the correct Backup Group in GUI Console
3. Select the Client which is having Issue
4. Open alert log for analysis
5. Troubleshoot as per the error
6. Please refer Column J for Further Resolution Steps
