QUESTION:

- How to capture the filename only from the <directory>/<File Name> output using the "Capture from job output" function on Control-M/Enterprise Manager Client?
- How to define a Control-M job that will extract specific word from the job's output on the Control-M Workload Automation (WLA) GUI?

ANSWER:

1. Launch the Control-M Workload Automation ( WLA ) GUI
2. Open the desired Workspace to edit the job
3. Go to the "Actions" Tab of the job properties
4. Click on the "+" icon under the "Capture from job output" section
5. Input the following details to capture the <File Name> only from the <Directory name>/<File Name> word in the output
    For example, the <Directory Name>/<File Name> is "/u01/controlm/ctmagent/BMC_OUTOUT.txt"
    - Variable Name: TESTCAP  
 - Variable Type: Global / Local - Search String: /u01/controlm/ctmagent/ Forward by: 0 Lines 0 Words Delimiter: White Space Capture: No of words: 1 6. Save the job and order as desired Note: In order for another job in a different Control-M Server to use this Variable (Autoedit), the AUTOEDIT must be a GLOBAL one (which is %%\TESTCAP).

Additional Information:
